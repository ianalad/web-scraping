# Web-Scraping with Python Beautiful Soup and Data Analysis

The purpose of this project is to scrape some of the data from www.skinnytaste.com web-site and to analyse it. The fruitful insights are given in the visualisation. Additionally, some of the interaction with the user is added. In other words, a user can input a calorie range, input a point range for the colour of choice and it will display the output of the first 5 foods with the image based on the selected criteria.
